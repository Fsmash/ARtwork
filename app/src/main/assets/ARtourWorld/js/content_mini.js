His family moved to the Central Valley when he was 16, and he finished high school just before America joined the second world war. After working in the San Francisco bay ship yards, where he perfected his musical talent by entertaining fellow workers during lunch breaks, he went south again and found gigs in Bakersfield and Las Vegas. For a time, he was pianist and fiddler for Tommy Duncan, the vocalist who sang with the renowned band leader and fellow Texan, Bob Wills.<\/span><\/p>","type":"HTMLDrawable","zOrder":1005,"y":78.06950270650505,"x":45.59609192037471}],"scaleFactor":0.833984375,"active":true,"label":"billwoods","zoomFactor":100,"size":{"height":1365,"width":1024}}]};
